>> <h3> Description </h3>
-------------------------

<p> In the realm of Dreaming, its ruler SANDMAN, DREAM has a certain hobby; books.
In his castle there is a Library in which they are kept, among other things,
stories conceived by their authors but never written in our reality;
Lucien, the person responsible for his organization, needs some help.
Many people dream of published books, sales markets, stories that, in their reality,
they would never imagine conceiving. And this voluminous data needs to be worked on.
In order not to get lost in the information, Lucien receives all his dreams in a Non-Relational bank, MONGO.
And he needs this to be organized in a relational way, that is, each author in his proper place.
For that he pulled our dream and saw this Architecture where data arrives in MONGO
undergo a transformation process in the STAGIN area and are populated in MYSQL.
In its population, we split two final tables.
One in its raw state, for complete queries, and another with metrics that informs the number of dreamers, their books and the total number of files.
In this way, data is more organized, undergoing deduplication and consolidation processes.</p>
